# AI2P-WindFarmControl - Learning-Based Wind Farm Control

This repository showcases research and experiments on using machine learning and reinforcement learning techniques for wind farm optimization and control. It is part of the AI2P final project.

## Overview

The main objective of this project is to explore data-driven methods to optimize wind farm operations using a combination of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and reinforcement learning. The work includes models designed to predict the fluid flow dynamics using Navier-Stokes equations and control algorithms aimed at maximizing power output by adjusting turbine settings.

### Key Features

- **Navier-Stokes Modeling**: Implementation of a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) to predict fluid dynamics using the Navier-Stokes equations.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Integration of the TD3 algorithm for continuous control in wind farm optimization.
- **Data-Driven Approach**: Utilizes high-fidelity simulation data for training and evaluation.
